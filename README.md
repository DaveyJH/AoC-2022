# Advent of Code 2022

The solutions applied are by no means the most efficient or most elegant. This
is a great set of puzzles for me to practice various techniques. The use of
Regex will feature heavily.

The aoc_data __init__.py file is worth a read, everything else is a bit of a
dive into the slightly unhinged mind that created them....i.e. mine!

Enjoy!
